# Stocks-Analysis
Using VBA to perform an analysis on data on stocks 

## Overview of Project 
The purpose of this analysis was to help Steve examine stock data to determine which would be the best for his parents to invest in. Total daily volume and yearly return were the two metrics used to measure stock success. Total daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout a day. The yearly return % is the difference in price from the beginning and the end of the year. 
	
Steve’s parents were very interested in seeing the success of the DQ stock. Further examining this stock we saw in 2018 DQ had a negative return of 62.6%. This means that owners of this stock had lost money if they owned it from Jan 1st to Dec 31st. This is not ideal when wanting to invest, so I dove deeper into looking at all 12 stocks to see which performed the best. 
	
By utilizing VBA’s tools I created an analysis that Steve or others could run off the spreadsheet using a button. This also allows him to run the analysis for the year of his choice.
